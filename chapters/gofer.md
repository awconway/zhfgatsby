<exercise id="1" title="Primary analysis including only studies that used core temperature as the comparator" type="slides">

<img src="/gofer/gofer_core.png" />

<qu>The study by Boisson et al. (2018) split the analyses in their study into times during surgery where there were 'rapid' core temperature changes and 'slow' core temperature changes. As such, the total number of participants reported here counts the number of participants in the Boisson et al. (2018) study twice.</qu>

<exercise id="2" title="Sensitivity analysis including only studies judged as low risk of bias" type="slides">
